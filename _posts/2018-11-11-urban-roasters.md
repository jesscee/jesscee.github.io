projectDesc: Urban Roasters is a boutique coffee roastery located in Canberra. This project involved the design and creation of the Urban Roasters logo along with custom graffiti-style artwork. Urban Roasters did not have an existing online presence, and so I was in charge of the full design and development of Urban Roaster's online coffee store.
