projectDesc: While working at Engineers Australia (EA), I was responsible for enhancing
  the user experience of EA's online offerings. My role also involved designing user interfaces, and the front-end development of these interfaces. I really enjoy hybrid roles where I can use a mixture of my skills to bring a product to life!

            <h2>Engineers Australia Online Portal</h2>
            <p>Engineers Australia had a major redesign to its public website. The website was given a modern look and feel, and the overarching structure of the site was improved.
            </p>
            <p>
            Engineers Australia's online customer Portal was not included in the redesign. This caused a jarring experience for users when transitioning between the website and Portal.
            <p>
                As the UX designer, I was responsible for improving the user experience of the Portal. We had a lot of feedback from existing users about their experience using the Portal (this was a great starting point!). There were a lot of pain-point areas for users that had to do with poor navigation. This project was not just about redesigning the Portal. There was clear evidence that we needed to fix the information architecture as well.</p>
            <p>
                I arranged workshops with stakeholders to discuss how we might make the experience better for users. The next stage involved design iteration, prototyping, and testing assumptions with users.

    <h2>Online Chartered application</h2>

    <p>I was the design lead for EA's online "Chartered" (a status you can achieve as an engineer) application. The application had to cater for non-members, members, and staff (assessors) to manage applications.</p>
<p>
There was an existing online application for Chartered, but it was very outdated and clunky (a lot of user dropouts). The application was in need of a redesign and enhancement to the experience. That's where I came in: working with stakeholders, I helped redesign the application. From wireframing, hi-fidelity prototyping right through to front-end development. I was responsible for getting the design created and developed.</p>
<p>
There was a lot of work involved in this project, as it wasn't only a redesign of the look and feel. It was an entire redesign of the user journey. This project had a very tight deadline, but the team worked hard and delivered a successful application on time.</p>
