                <p>While working at Defence Housing Australia (DHA), I helped redesign and development DHA's public-facing website, deisgn the UI for DHA's online services application, and assist in designing users interfaces for various other applications and systems.</p>

            <h2>Kiosk App UI</h2>
            <p>Sometimes defence members don't have internet access and/or reliable internet connection when deployed to regional areas. As DHA's Online Services is primarily online, it became increasingly apparent that users needed access to DHA's online services when visting a regional DHA Member Service branch.</p>
            <p>We spoke to users in regional areas, and asked them how we might help make access to online services easier for them. We found that there was a desire for users to be able to do tasks themselves, but still get help if needed. It was discovered that brining in kiosks (locked-down iPad on a stand) to reigonal DHA Member Service branches would most likely be the best solution for users.</p>
            <p>The kiosk would house DHA's online services application, and provide quick access to defence memeber-specific information without being in an authenticated space. A simple Kiosk UI interface was designed; this worked well with users and they were able to successfully find the information that they were after OR login to their DHA Online Services account. </p>

            <h2>Web App UI</h2>
            <p>This project involved updating the user interface (UI), making it mobile responsive, and enhancing the user experience of DHA's Online Services for defence members. Constant feedback from users told us the interface was difficult to navigate and users could not easily find what they needed to access. This put a strain on DHA's call centres; issues that could be fixed from a clearer UI.</p>
            <p>The new UI addressed common user needs, such as:
                <ul>
                    <li>make it easy for me to view my current housing solution, so I know my housing information.</li>
                    <li>make it easy for me to apply for things, so I can get my benefits.</li>
                    <li>make it easy for me to find new properties, so I have a place to live when I'm deployed.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h2>Design and Development</h2>
            <p>DHA's Online Services's UI was updated, so there was need (from a branding perspective) to align the design of the DHA public website to be consitent with DHA'S Online Services. </p>
            <p>I was the project lead, and liased with different areas of DHA to ensure that requirements were being met when redesigning the website. As DHA is a government website, it was important for the website to adhre to WCAG 2.0 Accessibility guidelines; To ensure the DHA website met WCAG 2.0, content changes and code changes were a requirement of this project. </p>
