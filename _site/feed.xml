&lt;div class=&quot;container&quot;&gt;
&lt;p class=&quot;lead&quot;&gt;An exciting project to be a part of. Building the official public website for the Australian Government's Digital Identity was very rewarding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Website design and development&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Digital Identity website was developed using Drupal 8. The design and theme was customised using the Australian Government Design System as guidance, ensuring that WCAG 2.1 Guidelines (Level AA) were adhered to. Making sure content is accessibile should always be a top priority for any website project. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class=&quot;mb-5&quot;&gt;The website content, information architecture, and the overall website structure was tested with users to see if users could successfully (and easily) find the information they were seeking. With the user research findings, we were able to make evidence-based content changes. It was extremely valuable to be able to test with users and get insights that we wouldnâ€™t have known had we only tested with internal users.&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;h2&gt;Engineers Australia Online Portal&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Engineers Australia had a major redesign to its public website. The website was given a modern look and feel, and the overarching structure of the site was improved.
            &lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
            Engineers Australia's online customer Portal was not included in the redesign. This caused a jarring experience for users when transitioning between the website and Portal.
            &lt;p&gt;
                As the UX designer, I was responsible for improving the user experience of the Portal. We had a lot of feedback from existing users about their experience using the Portal (this was a great starting point!). There were a lot of pain-point areas for users that had to do with poor navigation. This project was not just about redesigning the Portal. There was clear evidence that we needed to fix the information architecture as well.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;
                I arranged workshops with stakeholders to discuss how we might make the experience better for users. The next stage involved design iteration, prototyping, and testing assumptions with users.
            &lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;h2&gt;Online Chartered application&lt;/h2&gt;

    &lt;p&gt;I was the design lead for EA's online &quot;Chartered&quot; (a status you can achieve as an engineer) application. The application had to cater for non-members, members, and staff (assessors) to manage applications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was an existing online application for Chartered, but it was very outdated and clunky (a lot of user dropouts). The application was in need of a redesign and enhancement to the experience. That's where I came in: working with stakeholders, I helped redesign the application. From wireframing, hi-fidelity prototyping right through to front-end development. I was responsible for getting the design created and developed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
There was a lot of work involved in this project, as it wasn't only a redesign of the look and feel. It was an entire redesign of the user journey. This project had a very tight deadline, but the team worked hard and delivered a successful application on time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/P&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;I was responsible for the redesign of DHA's Online Services. This involved modernising the look and feel, making the interface responsive, and improving the user experience for defence members by addressing user pain points. Consistent feedback from members told us the interface was difficult to navigate and users could not find what they needed to access.

            &lt;h2&gt;Kiosk App UI&lt;/h2&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;Sometimes defence members don't have internet access or reliable internet connection when deployed to regional areas. As DHA's Online Services is primarily online, it became increasingly apparent that users needed access to DHA's online services when visting a regional DHA Member Service branch.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;We spoke to users in regional areas, and asked them how we might help make access to online services easier for them. We found that there was a desire for users to be able to do tasks themselves, but still get help if needed. As a potential solution, we trialed using kiosks (locked-down iPad on a stand) in reigonal DHA Member Service branches. This was a relatiely quick fix, and if it worked, would be very cost-effective to roll-out.
         
         &lt;p&gt;The kiosk trial worked very well, with members providing positive feedback. I designed a simple Kiosk user interface to accomodate entry into DHA's Online Services, and informational tutorials related to using DHA Online Services. 

            &lt;p&gt;Members in regional areas that may not have internet, now have access to DHA's Online Services.&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;

            &lt;p&gt;DHA's Online Services's user interface was updated, so there was a need (from a branding perspective) to align the design of the DHA public website to be consistent with DHA'S Online Services.&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;I was the project lead and liaised with different areas of DHA to ensure that requirements were being met when redesigning the website. As DHA is a government website, it was important for the website to adhere to WCAG 2.0 Accessibility guidelines. To ensure the DHA website met WCAG 2.0, content changes and semantic code changes were a fundamental part of this project.
            &lt;/p&gt;
