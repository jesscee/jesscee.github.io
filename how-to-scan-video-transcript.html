            <p>This is a transcript for the video on how to scan and upload documents when using Defence Housing Australia's (DHA) kiosk app. The kiosk app is only available at DHA's member service centres. </p>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> Place document on stand below.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> A iPad is mounted on a kiosk stand. There is a document stand positioned underneath the iPad. There is an arrow that points to the document stand, indicating to place the document you want to scan on this stand.</p>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> Press 'Take Photo or Video'. </p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> The screen of the iPad is displayed. There is a popup overlay, giving two options "Take Photo or Video" and "Choose Existing". The popup will open if you click on the "Browse" button when you need to supply an image to DHA. For example supplying a lease agreement document.</p>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> Press button to take photo. </p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> A screen of the iPad changes to indicate that you have selected an option in the previous screen. There is a camera button to press that will take a photo of your document.</p>
            <p><strong>Text:</strong> Your document has been scanned.</p>
            <p><strong>Visual:</strong> A big check mark appears on the screen, indicating that the document has been "scanned" and uploaded successfully.</p>
